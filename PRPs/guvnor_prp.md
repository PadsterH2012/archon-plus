  "status": "draft",

  "goal": "Design and implement a comprehensive governance and orchestration system for managing Archon's multi-agent workflows, including policy management, agent coordination, resource allocation, and workflow oversight capabilities that ensure efficient and controlled agent operations.",

  "why": [
    "Provide centralized governance for multiple AI agents operating within Archon ecosystem",
    "Implement policy-based control over agent behavior, resource usage, and workflow execution",
    "Enable intelligent agent coordination to prevent conflicts and optimize resource utilization",
    "Establish audit trails and compliance monitoring for enterprise-grade agent operations",
    "Create scalable orchestration framework that can manage complex multi-agent workflows",
    "Implement safety mechanisms and circuit breakers for agent operations"
  ],

  "what": {
    "description": "A comprehensive governance and orchestration system that manages multiple AI agents within Archon, providing policy enforcement, resource allocation, workflow coordination, and operational oversight. Guvnor acts as the central control plane for agent operations while maintaining integration with existing project and task management systems.",
    "success_criteria": [
      "Successfully manages concurrent execution of multiple agent workflows",
      "Policy engine enforces resource limits and operational constraints",
      "Agent coordination prevents conflicts and optimizes resource utilization",
      "Audit system provides complete traceability of agent operations",
      "Circuit breaker mechanisms prevent runaway agent processes",
      "Integration with existing Archon systems maintains backward compatibility",
      "Performance overhead is minimal (<5% impact on agent execution time)",
      "System scales to manage 50+ concurrent agent operations"
    ],
    "user_stories": [
      "As a system administrator, I want to define policies that limit agent resource usage and execution time",
      "As a project manager, I want to orchestrate multiple agents working on different project components simultaneously",
      "As a compliance officer, I want to audit all agent operations and ensure they follow organizational policies",
      "As a developer, I want agents to coordinate automatically to avoid conflicts when working on the same codebase",
      "As an operations team member, I want to monitor agent health and performance across all workflows",
      "As a team lead, I want to prioritize certain agent operations over others based on business requirements"
