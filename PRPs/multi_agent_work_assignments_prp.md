  "date": "2025-08-22",
  "status": "draft",

  "goal": "Extend Archon's existing task management system to automatically distribute tasks to AI agents based on capability matching, workload balancing, and intelligent assignment algorithms, building on the current component and template models to create an efficient multi-agent work distribution system.",

  "why": [
    "Automate task assignment to reduce manual overhead in multi-agent environments",
    "Optimize agent utilization by matching tasks to agent capabilities and availability",
    "Implement intelligent workload balancing to prevent agent overload and bottlenecks",
    "Leverage existing component hierarchy and template system for context-aware assignments",
    "Enable dynamic task redistribution based on agent performance and changing priorities",
    "Provide transparent assignment reasoning for audit and optimization purposes"
  ],

  "what": {
    "description": "An intelligent task distribution system that extends Archon's existing task management to automatically assign tasks to AI agents based on capability matching, current workload, task complexity, and component context. The system integrates with the component and template models to provide context-aware assignments while maintaining compatibility with existing manual assignment workflows.",
    "success_criteria": [
      "Automatic task assignment reduces manual assignment overhead by 80%",
      "Agent capability matching achieves >90% accuracy for task-agent compatibility",
      "Workload balancing maintains even distribution across available agents",
      "Assignment decisions are explainable and auditable",
      "System integrates seamlessly with existing component and template models",
      "Task reassignment handles agent failures and changing priorities dynamically",
      "Performance impact on existing task operations is minimal (<100ms overhead)",
      "Assignment algorithms scale to handle 100+ concurrent tasks across 10+ agents"
    ],
    "user_stories": [
      "As a project manager, I want tasks to be automatically assigned to the most suitable agents based on their capabilities",
      "As a team lead, I want to see why specific agents were chosen for tasks to understand the assignment logic",
      "As a developer, I want the system to balance workload across agents to prevent any single agent from being overwhelmed",
      "As an agent operator, I want tasks to be reassigned automatically if an agent becomes unavailable",
      "As a system administrator, I want to configure assignment policies and priorities for different types of work",
      "As a project stakeholder, I want high-priority tasks to be assigned to the most capable and available agents"
