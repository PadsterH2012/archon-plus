# Advanced Workflow Orchestration - Implementation Progress

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

### âœ… Completed Setup Tasks
- **Repository Setup**: Created `/mnt/network_repo/archon-plus` as development environment
- **Git Configuration**: Initialized git repository and pushed to `https://github.com/PadsterH2012/archon-plus.git`
- **Branch Creation**: Created feature branch `feature/advanced-workflow-orchestration`
- **Safe Development Environment**: Isolated from production Archon instance at `/mnt/working_dir/Archon-main`
- **Concept Analysis**: Completed comprehensive analysis in `docs/beneficial-project-concepts-analysis.md`

### ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview
**Advanced Workflow Orchestration** - A workflow catalog system where predefined workflows can be dynamically invoked by agents during task execution.

#### Core Concept Example:
```
Agent Task: "Create a new VM"
    â†“
System checks workflow catalog
    â†“
Finds "VM Creation Workflow"
    â†“
Agent follows predefined steps:
  1. Check resource availability
  2. Allocate IP address  
  3. Create VM in Proxmox
  4. Update CMDB â†’ (links to "CMDB Update Workflow")
  5. Setup backup schedule â†’ (links to "Backup Setup Workflow")
  6. Document deployment
```

  - CRUD operations for workflow templates
  - Workflow search and filtering
  - Version management for workflows

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Create workflow catalog API endpoints
  - `GET /api/workflows` - List available workflows
  - `POST /api/workflows` - Create new workflow
  - `GET /api/workflows/{id}` - Get workflow details
  - `PUT /api/workflows/{id}` - Update workflow
  - `DELETE /api/workflows/{id}` - Delete workflow

#### **Week 3: Basic Workflow Execution Engine**
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Implement WorkflowExecutor class
  - Step-by-step execution logic
  - Error handling and rollback mechanisms
  - Progress tracking and logging

  - Add workflow detection logic
  - Automatic workflow suggestion based on task description
  - Workflow parameter extraction from task context

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Workflow execution API
  - `POST /api/workflows/{id}/execute` - Start workflow execution
  - `GET /api/workflows/executions/{id}` - Get execution status
  - `POST /api/workflows/executions/{id}/pause` - Pause execution
  - `POST /api/workflows/executions/{id}/resume` - Resume execution

#### **Week 5: Testing & Basic UI**
- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Unit tests for workflow engine
  - Test workflow validation
  - Test execution engine
  - Test error handling and rollback

- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Basic workflow management UI
  - Workflow list view
  - Workflow details view
  - Simple workflow creation form

### **Phase 2: Visual Workflow Designer (3-4 weeks)**

#### **Week 6-7: Designer Components**
- [ ] **Task 6.1**: Implement drag-and-drop workflow canvas
  - React Flow or similar library integration
  - Step palette with available actions
  - Visual workflow representation

- [ ] **Task 6.2**: Step configuration panels
  - Dynamic forms for step parameters
  - Tool selection and configuration
  - Validation and preview

#### **Week 8-9: Advanced Designer Features**
- [ ] **Task 7.1**: Workflow validation and testing
  - Real-time validation of workflow structure
  - Test execution with mock data
  - Workflow export/import functionality

- [ ] **Task 7.2**: Template library integration
  - Pre-built workflow templates
  - Template categorization and search
  - Community workflow sharing

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)**

#### **Week 10-11: Workflow Chaining & Dependencies**
- [ ] **Task 8.1**: Implement workflow linking
  - Sub-workflow execution
  - Parameter passing between workflows
  - Dependency resolution

- [ ] **Task 8.2**: Conditional execution and branching
  - If/else logic in workflows
  - Dynamic step selection based on conditions
  - Loop and iteration support

#### **Week 12-13: Analytics & Optimization**

## ðŸ“ž Next Session Setup

### **When resuming work:**
1. **Navigate to development environment**: `cd /mnt/network_repo/archon-plus`
2. **Confirm branch**: `git branch` (should show `feature/advanced-workflow-orchestration`)
3. **Check Archon services**: Ensure production Archon is still running safely
4. **Start with Phase 1, Week 1, Task 1.1**: Database schema design
5. **Reference this file**: Use as roadmap and update progress as tasks complete

### **Development Environment Status**
- **Safe to modify**: âœ… Isolated from production
- **Git ready**: âœ… Feature branch created
- **Documentation**: âœ… Comprehensive analysis complete
- **Ready for implementation**: âœ… All prerequisites met
