# Agentic Workflow Framework - Project Design

## Executive Summary

A hierarchical workflow orchestration system that injects standardized operational tasks directly into agent instruction sets through template expansion. The framework uses **Workflows, Sequences, Actions** that are dynamically injected around user tasks, ensuring consistent operational procedures while maintaining the original task context.

## Core Concepts

### Hierarchical Task Structure
- **Projects** → **Milestones** → **Phases** → **Tasks** → **Subtasks**
- Each level can have attached workflows, sequences, and actions
- Template injection occurs at any hierarchy level with configurable frequency
- Reference system: `ProjectName::MilestoneName::TaskId`

### Template Injection System
The system transforms user instructions through template expansion:

```
User Input: "Creating a Dockerfile for a website"

Template Applied: workflow::default

Agent Receives:
{{group::understand_homelab_env}}
{{group::guidelines_coding}}
{{group::naming_conventions}}
{{group::testing_strategy}}
{{group::documentation_strategy}}

Creating a Dockerfile for a website  <<<< Original task preserved

{{group::create_tests}}
{{group::test_locally}}
{{group::commit_push_to_git}}
{{group::check_jenkins_build}}
{{group::send_task_to_review}}
```

### Workflow Components
- **Actions**: Atomic operations with natural language instructions (e.g., `{{action::git_commit}}`)
- **Sequences**: Ordered groups of related actions (e.g., `{{sequence::testing_pipeline}}`)
- **Workflows**: Complete operational templates that inject around user tasks (e.g., `workflow::default`, `workflow::milestone_pass`)

### Template Expansion
- All `{{group::name}}`, `{{sequence::name}}`, `{{action::name}}` variables expand to full instruction text
- Original user task remains intact and central
- Injection order is consistent regardless of user task content
- Different workflows can be applied based on context (project type, phase, milestone)

---

## Template Injection Architecture

### Injection Level Hierarchy
```
Project Level: workflow::project_setup (applied once per project)
├── Milestone Level: workflow::milestone_pass (applied per milestone)
│   ├── Phase Level: workflow::phase_complete (applied per phase)
│   │   ├── Task Level: workflow::default (applied per task)
│   │   │   └── Subtask Level: sequence::validation (applied per subtask)
```

### Template Categories by Frequency
- **Project Level**: Applied once during project initialization (`workflow::project_setup`)
- **Milestone Level**: Applied at milestone boundaries (`workflow::milestone_pass`, `workflow::release_actions`)
- **Phase Level**: Applied during phase transitions (`workflow::phase_complete`)
- **Task Level**: Applied to every task (`workflow::default`, `workflow::hotfix`)
- **Subtask Level**: Applied to granular operations (`sequence::validation`, `action::commit`)

### Template Injection Rules
1. **Preservation**: Original user task always preserved in center of injection
2. **Order Consistency**: Group/sequence order remains constant regardless of user task
3. **Level Specificity**: Higher frequency = more granular operational tasks
4. **Context Awareness**: Template selection based on project type, phase, urgency
5. **Non-Interference**: Injected instructions designed not to conflict with user task

### Template Variable Expansion
```
Template Definition:
workflow::default = [
  "{{group::understand_homelab_env}}",
  "{{group::guidelines_coding}}",
  "{{group::naming_conventions}}",
  "{{group::testing_strategy}}",
  "{{group::documentation_strategy}}",
  "{{USER_TASK}}",  // Placeholder for original task
  "{{group::create_tests}}",
  "{{group::test_locally}}",
  "{{group::commit_push_to_git}}",
  "{{group::check_jenkins_build}}",
  "{{group::send_task_to_review}}"
]

Expanded to Agent:
- Understand the homelab environment and available services
- Follow coding guidelines and best practices for this project
- Use consistent naming conventions across all code
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Document all changes and decisions

Creating a Dockerfile for a website  <<<< USER TASK

- Create appropriate unit and integration tests
- Test the implementation locally before committing
- Commit changes with descriptive messages and push to git
- Monitor Jenkins build status and handle any failures
- Send completed task for review and validation
```

## Template Injection Algorithm

### 1. Task Reception and Context Resolution
```
Input: User Task = "Creating a Dockerfile for a website"
Context: Project="Website Redesign", Milestone="Design Phase", Task="1.1"

Parse hierarchy path:
- Project: "Website Redesign" (ID: proj_123)
- Milestone: "Design Phase" (ID: milestone_456)
- Task: "1.1" (ID: task_789)

Resolve hierarchy context and determine injection level (Task Level)
```

### 2. Template Selection
```
Query template_assignments WHERE:
  hierarchy_type = 'task' AND
  hierarchy_id = task_789 AND
  is_active = true

If no specific assignment found, fall back to:
  - Phase level template
  - Milestone level template
  - Project level template
  - Global default template (workflow::default)

Selected: workflow::default
```

### 3. Template Expansion
```
Retrieve template_content from workflow_templates:
"{{group::understand_homelab_env}}
{{group::guidelines_coding}}
{{group::naming_conventions}}
{{group::testing_strategy}}
{{group::documentation_strategy}}
{{USER_TASK}}
{{group::create_tests}}
{{group::test_locally}}
{{group::commit_push_to_git}}
{{group::check_jenkins_build}}
{{group::send_task_to_review}}"

Replace {{USER_TASK}} with: "Creating a Dockerfile for a website"
```

### 4. Component Resolution and Expansion
```
For each {{group::name}} placeholder:
  1. Query template_components WHERE name = 'group::name'
  2. Retrieve instruction_text
  3. Apply project context to instruction template
  4. Validate required_tools are available
  5. Replace placeholder with expanded instruction

Example:
{{group::understand_homelab_env}} →
"Review the homelab documentation at /docs/homelab/ to understand
available services, network topology, and deployment targets.
Identify which services this Dockerfile will interact with."
```

### 5. Final Agent Instruction Assembly
```
Output complete instruction set:

1. Review the homelab documentation at /docs/homelab/...
2. Follow coding guidelines and best practices...
3. Use consistent naming conventions...
4. Implement comprehensive testing strategy...
5. Document all changes and decisions...

6. Creating a Dockerfile for a website  <<<< ORIGINAL TASK

7. Create appropriate unit and integration tests...
8. Test the implementation locally...
9. Commit changes with descriptive messages...
10. Monitor Jenkins build status...
11. Send completed task for review...

Total: Original task + 10 operational tasks = Complete workflow
```

### 6. Execution Tracking
```
Agent processes instruction set sequentially:
- Pre-task operations (steps 1-5): Setup and preparation
- Core task (step 6): User's original objective
- Post-task operations (steps 7-11): Validation and integration

System tracks completion of each component for:
- Progress reporting
- Workflow optimization
- Template effectiveness analysis
```

## Template System Implementation

### Project Creation with Templates

#### 1. Template Selection Process
```
User creates new project:
1. System presents template options:
   ├── Global Default (always available)
   ├── Industry Templates (Web Dev, Mobile, Research)
   ├── Team Templates (if user belongs to teams)
   ├── Personal Templates (user's saved templates)
   └── Community Templates (popular public templates)

2. User selects template or chooses "Custom"

3. System applies template hierarchy:
   ├── Start with Global Default workflows
   ├── Layer on selected template workflows
   ├── Apply any team-specific additions
   └── Allow user customizations before finalizing
```

#### 2. Template Application Algorithm
```
For selected template:
1. Resolve inheritance chain (template → parent → global)
2. Collect all workflow assignments per hierarchy level
3. Apply override rules (required vs. optional workflows)
4. Check for conflicts and dependencies
5. Present final configuration for user approval
6. Apply to new project with customization tracking
```

### Template Management Features

#### 1. Template Creation
```
From Existing Project:
- "Save Project as Template" 
- System extracts workflow configuration
- User defines template scope (personal/team/public)
- Set inheritance rules and required workflows

From Scratch:
- Start with base template or empty
- Add workflows at each hierarchy level
- Define default skip conditions
- Set execution triggers and repetition patterns
```

#### 2. Template Evolution
```
Template Updates:
- Modify existing template definitions
- System tracks version history
- Option to apply updates to existing projects
- Rollback capability for problematic updates

Learning Integration:
- System analyzes project success patterns
- Suggests template improvements
- Identifies commonly added/removed workflows
- Proposes new template variants
```

#### 3. Template Sharing and Discovery
```
Community Features:
- Publish templates publicly
- Browse template marketplace
- Rate and review templates
- Fork popular templates for customization
- Contribute improvements back to originals

Team Collaboration:
- Share templates within organization
- Team template inheritance
- Approval workflows for template changes
- Template usage analytics
```

### Smart Template Features

#### 1. Context-Aware Template Selection
```json
{
  "project_type": "e-commerce",
  "budget": "< $10k",
  "timeline": "< 2 months", 
  "team_size": 3,
  "suggested_template": "lean_ecommerce_variant",
  "reason": "Optimized for small team, tight timeline projects"
}
```

#### 2. Dynamic Template Customization
```
Automatic Adjustments:
- Budget constraints → Remove expensive workflows
- Timeline pressure → Defer non-critical workflows  
- Team expertise → Add/remove skill-specific workflows
- Client type → Apply compliance/process requirements

User Notification:
"Based on your project parameters, I've suggested modifications 
to the Web Development template. Review changes before applying."
```

#### 3. Template Validation and Warnings
```
Pre-Application Checks:
├── Dependency validation (required tools/skills)
├── Resource requirement warnings
├── Timeline feasibility analysis
├── Budget impact assessment
└── Team capacity considerations

Example Warning:
"This template includes advanced security workflows requiring 
specialized tools. Estimated additional cost: $500/month."
```

## Component Composition Rules

### Containment Hierarchy
```
Workflows CAN contain:
  ├── Actions (atomic operations)
  ├── Groups (clustered actions)  
  └── Other Workflows (nested orchestration)

Groups CAN contain:
  ├── Actions (atomic operations)
  └── Other Groups (nested clustering)
  └── CANNOT contain Workflows (maintains clear separation)

Actions:
  └── Leaf nodes only (no composition)
```

### Interface Contracts
Every component must define:
- **Input Schema**: What data/context it expects
- **Output Schema**: What it produces
- **Side Effects**: What it changes in the environment
- **Error Patterns**: How it can fail and recovery strategies

### Execution Patterns
- **Sequential**: `A → B → C` (default)
- **Parallel**: `A || B || C` (where dependencies allow)
- **Conditional**: `A → if(condition) B else C`
- **Error Handling**: `A catch B` (fallback actions)
- **Loops**: `repeat A until condition`

---

## Agent Integration Points

### 1. Task Injection and Processing
```
User Input: "Creating a Dockerfile for a website"

System Processing:
1. Identify hierarchy context (Project::Milestone::Task)
2. Select appropriate workflow template (workflow::default)
3. Expand template with component instructions
4. Inject user task at designated position
5. Return complete instruction set to agent

Agent Receives:
- 5 pre-task operational instructions
- 1 original user task (preserved exactly)
- 5 post-task operational instructions
- Total: 11-step comprehensive workflow
```

### 2. Component-Level Progress Tracking
```
Agent Reports: "Completed group::understand_homelab_env"

System Processing:
1. Mark component as completed in execution tracking
2. Update overall task progress (1/11 steps complete)
3. Prepare next component for execution
4. Log component completion time for optimization

Agent Reports: "Completed USER_TASK: Creating a Dockerfile for a website"

System Processing:
1. Mark core task as completed (6/11 steps complete)
2. Activate post-task operational components
3. Update project milestone progress
4. Trigger any dependent tasks
```

### 3. Template Context Queries
```
Agent Request: "What's the purpose of group::check_jenkins_build?"

System Response:
"This component ensures deployment readiness by:
- Monitoring the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline status
- Validating that all tests pass in the build environment
- Checking for any deployment blockers or failures
- Providing early warning of integration issues
- Required tools: web-fetch, launch-process
- Estimated duration: 5 minutes"
```

### 4. Workflow Adaptation and Alternatives
```
Agent Request: "Jenkins is down, can I skip group::check_jenkins_build?"

System Response:
1. Check component requirements and dependencies
2. Identify alternative validation methods
3. Suggest workflow modifications:
   "You can substitute with sequence::local_validation:
   - Run full test suite locally
   - Perform manual integration checks
   - Document Jenkins bypass in commit message
   - Schedule Jenkins validation for when service returns"
```

### 5. Template Override and Customization
```
Agent Request: "This task needs workflow::hotfix instead of workflow::default"

System Processing:
1. Validate hotfix workflow applicability
2. Re-expand instruction set with hotfix template
3. Preserve original user task in new template
4. Update execution tracking for new workflow
5. Notify of template change and adjusted expectations

New Instruction Set:
- 3 pre-task operational instructions (expedited)
- 1 original user task (unchanged)
- 3 post-task operational instructions (streamlined)
- Total: 7-step expedited workflow
```

---

## Key Benefits of Template Injection System

### 1. Task Preservation
- **Original Intent Maintained**: User tasks remain exactly as specified
- **Context Preservation**: Core task meaning never altered by operational procedures
- **Natural Flow**: Agent sees unified instruction set, not fragmented workflows
- **Debugging Clarity**: Easy to identify user task vs. operational overhead

### 2. Operational Consistency
- **Standardized Procedures**: Every task follows proven operational patterns
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Agents don't need to remember operational steps
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and testing procedures
- **Compliance Automation**: Regulatory and security requirements automatically included

### 3. Flexible Application
- **Multi-Level Injection**: Apply workflows at Project, Milestone, Phase, Task, or Subtask level
- **Frequency Control**: High-frequency (every task) vs. low-frequency (per milestone) workflows
- **Context-Aware Selection**: Different workflows for different project types or urgency levels
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Switch workflows mid-project based on changing requirements

### 4. Scalable Workflow Management
- **Reusable Components**: Groups, sequences, and actions can be shared across workflows
- **Template Evolution**: Workflows improve over time based on project outcomes
- **Organizational Learning**: Successful patterns automatically propagated to new projects
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with MCP tools and external services

### 5. Agent Experience Optimization
- **Single Instruction Stream**: Agent receives one coherent task list
- **Clear Dependencies**: Operational steps properly sequenced around user task
- **Progress Tracking**: Component-level completion tracking for detailed progress
- **Error Handling**: Built-in fallback procedures for common failure scenarios

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Template Design Principles
- **Non-Interference**: Operational instructions must not conflict with user task execution
- **Contextual Relevance**: Components should enhance rather than distract from core task
- **Tool Availability**: Validate required MCP tools are accessible before injection
- **Time Management**: Balance thoroughness with execution speed

### 2. Component Granularity
```
Action Level (1-3 minutes):
- Single atomic operation
- Minimal context switching
- Clear success criteria

Group Level (5-15 minutes):
- Related set of actions
- Logical operational unit
- Shared context and tools

Sequence Level (10-30 minutes):
- Ordered workflow segment
- Multiple groups or actions
- Specific outcome focus

Workflow Level (30+ minutes):
- Complete operational template
- Multiple sequences and groups
- End-to-end process coverage
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Template Caching**: Pre-compile frequently used templates
- **Lazy Expansion**: Only expand components when needed
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute independent components concurrently
- **Resource Management**: Monitor tool usage and availability

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Template Validation**: Verify component compatibility before deployment
- **Execution Monitoring**: Track component success rates and failure patterns
- **Feedback Integration**: Use agent feedback to improve template effectiveness
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different workflow approaches for optimization

This enhanced framework now provides a complete template ecosystem that solves the core problem of "remembering everything" while maintaining maximum flexibility. The template system ensures every project starts with intelligent defaults based on proven patterns, while the skip logic and customization options provide the flexibility needed for real-world project variations.

The key innovation is that your agent becomes not just a task executor, but an organizational memory system that learns and improves over time, ensuring that hard-won project management knowledge is captured, shared, and automatically applied to future projects.
