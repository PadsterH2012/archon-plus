# Knowledge Base Recrawl Investigation Report

**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Issue:** Fix Knowledge Base Recrawl Functionality
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix Implemented and Deployed - Testing Shows Continued Issues
**Investigator:** AI IDE Agent
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-23 10:40 UTC

## Executive Summary

Investigation into the knowledge base recrawl functionality revealed that the core issue was **not** a broken indexing pipeline as initially suspected, but rather **overly aggressive code extraction filtering** that was preventing legitimate code blocks from being stored in the `archon_code_examples` table.

### Key Findings

1. **‚úÖ Content Processing Working:** The upload API, content processing, and embedding generation are functioning correctly
2. **‚úÖ RAG Queries Working:** Text-based search returns relevant results from indexed content
3. **‚ùå Code Extraction Failing:** Code blocks are detected but not extracted due to filtering issues
4. **üîß Fix Implemented:** Modified diagram filtering logic to preserve directory tree structures
5. **üì¶ Fix Deployed:** Code changes committed (ebe3c23) and deployed to archon-dev
6. **‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Results:** Fix deployed but code extraction still not working - requires further investigation

## Technical Investigation Details

### Database State Analysis

**archon_crawled_pages Table:**
- Status: ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Content: 135 chunks with embeddings in production
- Functionality: Content properly indexed and searchable

**archon_code_examples Table:**
- Status: ‚ùå Empty (0 entries)
- Issue: Code blocks detected (`has_code: true`) but not extracted
- Impact: Code search functionality unavailable

### Root Cause Analysis

**Original Hypothesis:** Broken indexing pipeline between upload API and content processing

**Actual Root Cause:** Overly aggressive diagram filtering in `code_storage_service.py`

**Specific Issue:** Bash/shell code blocks containing directory tree structures were being incorrectly classified as ASCII art diagrams due to:

1. **Box Drawing Characters:** Directory trees use `‚îú`, `‚îî`, `‚îÇ`, `‚îÄ` characters
2. **Diagram Detection Logic:** System counted ‚â•5 diagram indicators + <5 code patterns = classified as diagram
3. **False Positive Filtering:** Legitimate bash code blocks filtered out as "ASCII art"

**Example Affected Content:**
```bash
project-structure/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Modal.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
```

This 800-character bash code block was being filtered out despite being legitimate code.

### Fix Implementation

**File Modified:** `python/src/server/services/storage/code_storage_service.py`

**Key Changes:**
1. **Directory Tree Detection:** Added intelligent detection for bash/shell directory trees
2. **Language-Specific Filtering:** Different diagram filtering rules for bash vs other languages
3. **Threshold Adjustments:** Increased diagram detection thresholds (5‚Üí8 indicators, 3‚Üí5 special lines)
4. **Preservation Logic:** Explicitly preserve directory structures in bash/shell code blocks

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Added directory tree detection
is_directory_tree = (
    language in ["bash", "shell", "sh", "zsh", "fish", "cmd", "powershell", "ps1"] and
    any(indicator in code_content for indicator in ["‚îú", "‚îî", "‚îÇ", "‚îÄ"]) and
    any(pattern in code_content.lower() for pattern in ["/", "\\", ".py", ".js", ".ts"])
)

# Skip diagram filtering for directory trees
if not is_directory_tree:
    # Apply diagram filtering logic
    # ... (more restrictive thresholds)
```

## Testing Results

### Production Environment (archon-prod)
- **Content Processing:** ‚úÖ Working
- **Code Detection:** ‚úÖ Working (`has_code: true` detected)
- **Code Extraction:** ‚ùå Not working (archon_code_examples empty)
- **Test Case:** `file_agentic_workflow_framework_implementation_md_1755859732` contains bash directory tree but no code examples extracted

### Development Environment (archon-dev)
- **Deployment:** ‚úÖ Code fix deployed successfully
- **Content Processing:** ‚úÖ Working
- **Test File:** ‚úÖ `test_code_extraction_dev.md` uploaded and processed
- **Code Detection:** ‚úÖ Working (`has_code: true` on all chunks)
- **Code Extraction:** ‚ùå Still not working (search_code_examples returns empty)

### Test Content Verified
The test file contains multiple code blocks that should be extracted:
- **Bash Directory Tree:** 800+ characters with box drawing characters
- **Python Function:** Substantial code block with proper syntax
- **SQL Queries:** Database creation and insertion statements

All code blocks meet minimum length requirements and contain proper code patterns.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Root Cause Identified:** Diagram filtering too aggressive
2. **Fix Developed:** Smart directory tree detection implemented
3. **Code Committed:** Changes pushed to main branch (commit ebe3c23)
4. **Deployed to Dev:** Manual stack update completed on archon-dev
5. **Content Verified:** Test content properly processed and indexed

### ‚ùå Outstanding Issues
1. **Code Extraction Still Failing:** Despite fix, code examples not being extracted
2. **Service Reload:** Python service may not have reloaded updated code
3. **Alternative Filtering:** Other filtering logic may be preventing extraction
4. **Configuration Issues:** Code extraction may be disabled in dev environment

### üîç Next Investigation Steps
1. **Verify Service Restart:** Ensure archon-dev server restarted after deployment
2. **Check Extraction Logs:** Review logs for filtering messages or errors
3. **Debug Code Path:** Verify updated code is actually being executed
4. **Database Direct Query:** Check archon_code_examples table directly
5. **Configuration Review:** Verify code extraction settings in dev environment

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Service Restart:** Force restart of archon-dev server to ensure code reload
2. **Log Analysis:** Review extraction service logs for detailed error information
3. **Direct Database Check:** Query archon_code_examples table to confirm empty state
4. **Settings Verification:** Check code extraction configuration in dev environment
